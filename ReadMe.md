check inet_pton() for ip adress;


[PORTNUMBERS] :
<Turns out that besides an IP address (used by the IP layer), there is another address that is used by TCP
(stream sockets) and, coincidentally, by UDP (datagram sockets). It is the port number. It’s a 16-bit
number that’s like the local address for the connection.
Think of the IP address as the street address of a hotel, and the port number as the room number. That’s a
decent analogy; maybe later I’ll come up with one involving the automobile industry.
Say you want to have a computer that handles incoming mail AND web services—how do you differentiate
between the two on a computer with a single IP address?>
